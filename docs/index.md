Welcome to Dissect!
===================

Dissect is a set of tools for lexical and syntactical analysis
written in pure PHP.

This guide assumes that you're already familiar with basics concepts
of parsing. Explaining them is beyond the scope of this simple guide,
so if you're not, see, for example, [this article][parsing].
This page serves as an index for individual documentation pages.
